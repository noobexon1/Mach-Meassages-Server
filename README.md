# Server

<u>How to run:</u>

1) Clone server.
2) Clone client (https://github.com/noobexon1/Client).
3) Build both.
4) Run server first.
5) Open as many clients as you want.

How to use the clients:

Clients have basic ui with 3 commands:

1) "send" -> You will be promted to provide input data -> Data will then be sent to be stored on the server.
2) "retrieve" -> Data will be received from the server by queue behavier (first message sent to the server will be received first).
3) "quit" -> Exit the client (This is not neccasery. The server will manage no matter what happens to the client).

After every action taken by clients, log messages will appear on both client an server screens to describe what is going on every step.
